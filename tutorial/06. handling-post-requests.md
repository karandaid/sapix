# **Sapix Tutorial - Lesson 6: Handling POST Requests**

## **Overview**

In this lesson, you will learn how to handle **POST requests** in **SapixRoutes**. POST requests are typically used when the client needs to send data to the server, such as creating a new resource, submitting form data, or performing any other action that modifies data on the server. We’ll explore how to handle the incoming data from the request body and how to respond appropriately.

## **What You Will Learn**

- How to define routes that handle **POST requests**.
- How to access and process the request body in **SapixRoutes**.
- Examples of creating resources and sending structured data to the server.

## **Step 1: Understanding POST Requests**

POST requests are used when you need to send data from the client to the server. This data is typically sent in the **request body**, and the server processes the data to create or update resources. POST is often used for creating new users, submitting forms, uploading files, or sending complex data structures.

---

## **Step 2: Handling POST Requests in SapixRoutes**

Let’s define a route in **SapixRoutes** that accepts POST requests and processes the incoming data from the request body.

### **Example Code: Handling POST Requests**

```javascript
import { SapixServer, SapixRoutes } from 'sapix';

// Create a new instance of SapixRoutes
const routes = new SapixRoutes();

// Define a POST route that accepts data in the request body
routes.prefix('/api/v1')
    .post('/user', (res, query, path_params, body) => {
        // Access the request body to retrieve data
        const { name, email } = body;

        // Check if both name and email are provided
        if (!name || !email) {
            return res.status(400).sendJSON({
                error: 'Name and email are required fields',
            });
        }

        // Respond with a success message and echo the submitted data
        res.status(201).sendJSON({
            message: 'User created successfully',
            user: {
                name: name,
                email: email,
            },
        });
    });

// Initialize the server and attach the routes
const server = new SapixServer()
    .setPort(4000)
    .setRoute(routes)
    .start();

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000');
```

### **Explanation**:
- **POST Request**: The `.post()` method defines a route that listens for POST requests at `/api/v1/user`.
- **Request Body**: The `body` object contains the data sent in the POST request. In this case, we expect `name` and `email` fields.
- **Validation**: If either `name` or `email` is missing, the server responds with a `400 Bad Request` and an error message. Otherwise, it responds with `201 Created` and returns the submitted data.

---

## **Step 3: Testing POST Requests**

Let’s test the route using an API client like **Postman** or **curl** to send a POST request with a JSON body.

### **Example Request**:
**POST** `/api/v1/user`

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### **Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "user": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

If you send a POST request without the `name` or `email` fields, the server will respond with an error message:

### **Example Request (Missing Email)**:
**POST** `/api/v1/user`

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### **Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "Name and email are required fields"
}
```

---

## **Step 4: Working with Different Content Types**

By default, **POST requests** typically send data in **JSON** format, but you can also handle other content types, such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for form data. In this example, we’re focusing on JSON, but you can extend the handler to work with other content types as needed.

### **Supporting Other Content Types**:
To handle other content types, you may need to parse the body accordingly, but Sapix’s internal handling of JSON is typically sufficient for most use cases involving POST requests.

---

## **Practical Use Cases for POST Requests**

Here are a few examples of how POST requests are used in real-world applications:

- **Creating a New User**: Send user data (like name and email) to create a new user in the system.
- **Submitting a Form**: Send form data (like contact forms or registration forms) to the server.
- **Uploading Files**: POST requests are also used to upload files by including file data in the request body.
- **Placing an Order**: Send order details (like items and quantities) to submit a purchase order.

## **Step 5: Advanced Example - Creating Multiple Users**

Here’s how you could handle multiple users in a single POST request by accepting an array of users:

### **Example Code: Creating Multiple Users**

```javascript
routes.post('/users', (res, query, path_params, body) => {
    const users = body.users;

    if (!Array.isArray(users)) {
        return res.status(400).sendJSON({
            error: 'Users must be an array',
        });
    }

    const createdUsers = users.map(user => ({
        name: user.name,
        email: user.email,
    }));

    res.status(201).sendJSON({
        message: 'Users created successfully',
        users: createdUsers,
    });
});
```

### **Example Request**:
**POST** `/api/v1/users`

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
    { "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com" }
  ]
}
```

### **Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Users created successfully",
  "users": [
    { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
    { "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com" }
  ]
}
```

## **Conclusion**

In this lesson, you learned how to handle **POST requests** in **SapixRoutes**. POST requests are essential for sending data to the server, whether it's creating new resources, submitting forms, or uploading files. You explored how to access the request body, validate the data, and send appropriate responses based on the input.

In the next lesson, we’ll cover **sending JSON responses** in more depth, including formatting responses and handling different response scenarios.
