# **Sapix Tutorial - Lesson 3: Handling Dynamic Path Parameters**

## **Overview**

In this lesson, you will learn how to create flexible and dynamic routes in **Sapix** by using **path parameters**. Path parameters allow you to define placeholders in your route that can capture dynamic values, making your API more flexible and able to handle different inputs for the same route pattern.

---

## **What You Will Learn**

- How to define routes with dynamic path parameters.
- How to access and use dynamic values in your route handlers.
- Examples of dynamic routes and how to work with path parameters in **Sapix**.

## **Step 1: Defining Dynamic Path Parameters**

A **dynamic path parameter** is defined by using a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name in your route definition. You can then access the value of the parameter in your route handler through the `path_params` object.

Let’s create a dynamic route that handles user profiles by their `id`.

Update your `index.js` file:

```javascript
import { SapixServer, SapixRoutes } from 'sapix';

// Create a new instance of SapixRoutes
const routes = new SapixRoutes();

// Define a route with dynamic path parameter (e.g., /user/:id)
routes.prefix('/api/v1')
    .get('/user/:id', (res, query, path_params) => {
        // Access the dynamic path parameter using path_params
        const userId = path_params.id;

        // Send back a JSON response with the captured user ID
        res.status(200).sendJSON({
            message: `Fetching data for user with ID: ${userId}`,
            userId: userId,
        });
    });

// Initialize the server and attach routes
const server = new SapixServer()
    .setPort(4000)    // Set the server to listen on port 4000
    .setRoute(routes) // Attach the routes to the server
    .start();         // Start the server

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000');
```

### **Explanation**:
- The route `/user/:id` uses `:id` as a **dynamic path parameter**.
- In the route handler, `path_params.id` captures the value from the URL. For example, if the user visits `/api/v1/user/123`, `path_params.id` will be `123`.
- We send a JSON response with the captured `id`.

---

## **Step 2: Running the Server**

Run the server by using:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see the message:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:4000
```

---

## **Step 3: Testing the Dynamic Route**

Now, let’s test the dynamic route using a browser or an API testing tool like Postman.

1. Visit `http://localhost:4000/api/v1/user/123`:
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Fetching data for user with ID: 123",
       "userId": "123"
     }
     ```

2. Try another user ID by visiting `http://localhost:4000/api/v1/user/456`:
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Fetching data for user with ID: 456",
       "userId": "456"
     }
     ```

As you can see, the route is dynamically handling different values for `id`, capturing and responding with the appropriate data.

---

## **Step 4: Using Multiple Dynamic Parameters**

You can also use multiple dynamic parameters in a single route. Let’s extend the example to handle both `userId` and `postId` for fetching a user’s specific post.

Update your route definition as follows:

```javascript
// Define a route with multiple dynamic path parameters (e.g., /user/:userId/post/:postId)
routes.prefix('/api/v1')
    .get('/user/:userId/post/:postId', (res, query, path_params) => {
        const userId = path_params.userId;
        const postId = path_params.postId;

        // Send back a JSON response with both captured parameters
        res.status(200).sendJSON({
            message: `Fetching post with ID: ${postId} for user with ID: ${userId}`,
            userId: userId,
            postId: postId,
        });
    });
```

### **Explanation**:
- This route `/user/:userId/post/:postId` captures two dynamic parameters, `userId` and `postId`.
- You can access both values through the `path_params` object (`path_params.userId` and `path_params.postId`).

---

## **Step 5: Testing Multiple Dynamic Parameters**

Test this route by visiting:

1. `http://localhost:4000/api/v1/user/123/post/456`:
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Fetching post with ID: 456 for user with ID: 123",
       "userId": "123",
       "postId": "456"
     }
     ```

2. You can try any combination of `userId` and `postId` to see how it responds dynamically.

## **Conclusion**

In this lesson, you learned how to create dynamic routes in **Sapix** by using **path parameters**. This powerful feature allows you to handle flexible URLs where specific segments can change, such as user IDs, product IDs, or other entities. You also explored how to use multiple dynamic parameters in a single route.

In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to work with **path parameters with DataTypes** to make your routes even more dynamic and flexible.
