# **Sapix Tutorial - Lesson 1: Introduction and Basic Route Setup**

## **Overview**

Welcome to the first lesson of the **Sapix** tutorial series! In this lesson, you'll get hands-on experience with **Sapix** by setting up a basic server and creating your first route. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand how to use **SapixServer** and **SapixRoutes** to create simple, functional API routes.

## **What You Will Learn**

- Setting up a project with **Sapix**.
- Creating a basic server with **SapixServer**.
- Defining a simple route using **SapixRoutes**.

---

## **Step 1: Install Sapix**

First, let's install **Sapix** via npm to your project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install sapix
```

This will install the **Sapix** library and add it to your `package.json` file.

---

## **Step 2: Project Structure**

Next, set up your project structure. Create a new directory and initialize a basic Node.mjs project:

```bash
mkdir sapix-app
cd sapix-app
npm init -y
```

Your project structure should look like this:

```
sapix-app/
├── index.mjs           // Main server script
└── package.json       // Project metadata and dependencies
```

---

## **Step 3: Create a Basic Server**

Now, let's create your first server using **SapixServer** and **SapixRoutes**. In your `index.mjs` file, write the following code:

```javascript
import { SapixServer, SapixRoutes } from 'sapix';

// Create a new instance of SapixRoutes
const routes = new SapixRoutes();

// Define a basic GET route
routes.get('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Welcome to SapixRoutes Home Page!');
});

// Create a new server and set the port to 4000
const server = new SapixServer()
    .setPort(4000)    // Specify the port
    .setRoute(routes) // Attach the routes
    .start();         // Start the server

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000');
```

### **Explanation**:
- **SapixRoutes**: This is where you define your routes. The `get()` method defines a route that listens for `GET` requests.
- **SapixServer**: This initializes the server, assigns the port, and attaches the routes before starting the server.

---

## **Step 4: Running the Server**

To start your server, simply run:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

This will start the server on port **4000**. You should see the message:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:4000
```

Now, open your browser or Postman and visit `http://localhost:4000/`. You should see the message:

```
Welcome to SapixRoutes Home Page!
```

---

## **Step 5: Next Steps**

In this lesson, you've learned how to:
- Install **Sapix**.
- Set up a basic server with **SapixServer**.
- Create a simple `GET /` route with **SapixRoutes**.

In the next lesson, you'll explore how to create more advanced routes using **SapixRoutes** with dynamic path parameters and query parameters.

## **Conclusion**

You've successfully set up a simple **Sapix** server! Keep experimenting with more routes, and stay tuned for the next lesson, where you'll dive deeper into building dynamic routes and handling path parameters.
