# **Sapix Tutorial - Lesson 16: Understanding Middleware Annotations and Protocol-Based Execution (HTTP vs HTTPS)**

## **Overview**

In this lesson, you'll deepen your understanding of **Sapix** by exploring how **middlewares** operate differently based on the protocol usedâ€”**HTTP** or **HTTPS**. You'll learn how to effectively use **annotations** like `@method` and `@secure` to control middleware execution, ensuring that your API behaves securely and efficiently. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Comprehend the role of middlewares in **Sapix**.
- Utilize `@method` and `@secure` annotations to manage middleware behavior.
- Configure your **SapixServer** to handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests.
- Understand which middlewares execute under different protocols.

## **What You Will Learn**

- **Middleware Annotations**: Detailed explanation of `@method` and `@secure` annotations.
- **Protocol-Based Middleware Execution**: How middlewares behave differently under HTTP and HTTPS.
- **Practical Implementation**: Setting up middlewares with annotations and configuring the server for HTTP and HTTPS.
- **Testing and Verification**: Ensuring that middlewares execute as intended based on the protocol.

---

## **Middleware Annotations Explained**

### **1. `@method` Annotation**

The `@method` annotation specifies which HTTP methods a middleware should respond to. This allows you to restrict middleware execution to specific request types, enhancing control and security.

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
    @method get, patch, post
*/
```

In this example, the middleware will only execute for `GET`, `PATCH`, and `POST` requests.

### **2. `@secure` Annotation**

The `@secure` annotation determines whether a middleware should only execute over secure connections (HTTPS). Currently, **Sapix** supports the `HTTPS` value for this annotation, meaning the middleware will only run if the request is made over HTTPS.

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
    @secure HTTPS
*/
```

This middleware will **only** execute when the incoming request uses the `HTTPS` protocol.

---

## **Setting Up Middleware for HTTP and HTTPS**

Understanding how middlewares interact with different protocols is crucial for building secure and efficient APIs. Let's explore how to set up and configure middlewares based on whether your server is running over HTTP or HTTPS.

### **1. Server Configuration**

First, ensure that your server can handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests. Below is a sample setup that enables HTTPS while still allowing HTTP requests.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { SapixServer, SapixRoutes } from 'sapix';
import path from 'path';

// Initialize routes
const routes = new SapixRoutes();

// Define various routes
routes.get('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Get Route');
});
routes.patch('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Patch Route');
});
routes.post('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Post Route');
});
routes.get('/profile/:id/user/:userId', (res, req, query, path_params) => {
    res.status(200).sendJSON({ message: 'This is a JSON response.', query, path_params });
});
routes.get('/profile', (res, req, query, path_params) => {
    res.status(200).sendJSON({ message: 'This is a JSON response.', query, path_params });
});
routes.post('/secure', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Post');
});
```

### **2. Adding Middlewares with Annotations**

Middlewares can be added globally or to specific routes. Annotations help control their execution based on HTTP methods and protocol security.

**Global Middleware:**
```javascript
// Middleware that works for every path and all methods
routes.tap((response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    console.log('Global Middleware: Method -', request.getMethod(), '| Secure -', request.isSecure());
    next();
});
```

**Annotated Middlewares:**
```javascript
// Middleware for specific methods and HTTPS only
routes.tap((response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    /**
        @method get, patch, post
        @secure HTTPS
    */
    console.log('Secure Middleware: GET, PATCH, POST methods over HTTPS');
    next();
});

// Middleware for a specific route and method
routes.tap('/secure', (response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    /**
       @method post
    */
    console.log('Route-Specific Middleware: POST method on /secure route');
    next();
});

// Middleware for a specific route without method restriction
routes.tap('/profile', (response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    console.log('Route-Specific Middleware: Any method on /profile route');
    next();
});
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Global Middleware**: Executes for every request, regardless of the path or method. Logs the HTTP method and whether the request is secure.

2. **Secure Middleware**: Executes **only** for `GET`, `PATCH`, and `POST` methods **and** when the request is made over `HTTPS`. This is enforced by the `@method` and `@secure` annotations.

3. **Route-Specific Middleware**: Executes **only** for the `/secure` route with the `POST` method, as specified by the `@method post` annotation.

4. **Another Route-Specific Middleware**: Executes for any method on the `/profile` route without any method restrictions.

### **3. Starting the Server with HTTPS Enabled**

To enable HTTPS, provide the necessary SSL certificates when configuring the **SapixServer**.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const server = new SapixServer()
    .setPort(4000)
    .enableHttps({
        key: fs.readFileSync('private-key.pem'),
        cert: fs.readFileSync('certificate.pem'),
    })
    .setRoutes(routes)
    .start();

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000 and https://localhost:4000');
```

**Note:**
- Ensure you have valid `private-key.pem` and `certificate.pem` files in your project directory.
- The server will listen on both HTTP and HTTPS protocols on port `4000`.

---

## **Practical Code Example**

Let's integrate all the concepts discussed so far into a comprehensive example. This setup includes various routes and middlewares with different annotations to demonstrate their behavior under HTTP and HTTPS.

**Complete Code Example:**
```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { SapixServer, SapixRoutes } from 'sapix';
import path from 'path';

const routes = new SapixRoutes();

// Define routes
routes.get('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Get Route');
});
routes.patch('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Patch Route');
});
routes.post('/', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Post Route');
});
routes.get('/profile/:id/user/:userId', (res, req, query, path_params) => {
    res.status(200).sendJSON({ message: 'This is a JSON response.', query, path_params });
});
routes.get('/profile', (res, req, query, path_params) => {
    res.status(200).sendJSON({ message: 'This is a JSON response.', query, path_params });
});
routes.post('/secure', (res) => {
    res.status(200).sendText('Post');
});

// Global Middleware: Executes for every request
routes.tap((response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    console.log('Global Middleware:', request.getMethod(), request.isSecure());
    next();
});

// Secure Middleware: Executes only for GET, PATCH, POST methods over HTTPS
routes.tap((response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    /**
        @method get, patch, post
        @secure HTTPS
    */
    console.log('Secure Middleware: GET, PATCH, POST methods over HTTPS');
    next();
});

// Middleware for /secure route with POST method
routes.tap('/secure', (response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    /**
       @method post
    */
    console.log('Route-Specific Middleware: POST method on /secure route');
    next();
});

// Middleware for /profile route with any method
routes.tap('/profile', (response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
    console.log('Route-Specific Middleware: Any method on /profile route');
    next();
});

// This middleware is commented out and will never execute
// routes.tap('/profile/:id/user/:userId', (response, request, query, routePathParameters, body, next) => {
//     console.log('Only with profile', request.getFullUrl());
//     next()
// });

const server = new SapixServer()
    .setPort(4000)
    .enableHttps({
        key: fs.readFileSync('private-key.pem'),
        cert: fs.readFileSync('certificate.pem'),
    })
    .setRoutes(routes)
    .start();

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000 and https://localhost:4000');
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Routes Defined**:
    - **Root Routes**: `GET /`, `PATCH /`, `POST /`.
    - **Dynamic Routes**: `GET /profile/:id/user/:userId`, `GET /profile`.
    - **Secure Route**: `POST /secure`.

2. **Middlewares**:
    - **Global Middleware**: Logs every request's method and security status.
    - **Secure Middleware**: Logs only `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` requests made over `HTTPS`.
    - **Route-Specific Middlewares**:
        - `/secure`: Logs only `POST` requests on this route.
        - `/profile`: Logs any method on this route.

3. **Server Configuration**:
    - **HTTPS Enabled**: Uses `private-key.pem` and `certificate.pem`.
    - **Listens on Port 4000**: Accessible via both `http://localhost:4000` and `https://localhost:4000`.

## **Middleware Execution Scenarios**

Let's explore how the middlewares execute under different protocols and routes based on the provided setup.

### **1. HTTP Requests (`http://localhost:4000`)**

**a. Request: `GET /`**

- **Middlewares Executed**:
    1. **Global Middleware**: Logs method and security (`GET`, `false`).
    2. **Secure Middleware**: **Does not execute** because the request is not secure (`HTTP`).

**b. Request: `POST /secure`**

- **Middlewares Executed**:
    1. **Global Middleware**: Logs method and security (`POST`, `false`).
    2. **Secure Middleware**: **Does not execute** because the request is not secure (`HTTP`).
    3. **Route-Specific Middleware for `/secure`**: Executes because the route and method match, regardless of security.

**c. Request: `GET /profile/123/user/456`**

- **Middlewares Executed**:
    1. **Global Middleware**: Logs method and security (`GET`, `false`).
    2. **Secure Middleware**: **Does not execute** because the request is not secure (`HTTP`).
    3. **Route-Specific Middleware for `/profile`**: Executes because the route matches.

### **2. HTTPS Requests (`https://localhost:4000`)**

**a. Request: `GET /`**

- **Middlewares Executed**:
    1. **Global Middleware**: Logs method and security (`GET`, `true`).
    2. **Secure Middleware**: Executes because the request is secure (`HTTPS`) and method is `GET`.

**b. Request: `POST /secure`**

- **Middlewares Executed**:
    1. **Global Middleware**: Logs method and security (`POST`, `true`).
    2. **Secure Middleware**: Executes because the request is secure (`HTTPS`) and method is `POST`.
    3. **Route-Specific Middleware for `/secure`**: Executes because the route and method match.

**c. Request: `GET /profile/123/user/456`**

- **Middlewares Executed**:
    1. **Global Middleware**: Logs method and security (`GET`, `true`).
    2. **Secure Middleware**: Executes because the request is secure (`HTTPS`) and method is `GET`.
    3. **Route-Specific Middleware for `/profile`**: Executes because the route matches.

## **Testing the Middleware Behavior**

To verify that middlewares are executing as intended based on the protocol and route, follow these testing steps:

### **1. Running the Server**

Ensure your server is running with both HTTP and HTTPS enabled:

```bash
node index.mjs
```

You should see:

```
Server is running on http://localhost:4000 and https://localhost:4000
```

### **2. Making Requests**

Use tools like **Postman**, **cURL**, or a web browser to make requests to your server.

**a. Testing HTTP Requests**

- **GET /**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:4000/
  ```

  **Console Output:**
  ```
  Global Middleware: GET false
  ```

- **POST /secure**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/secure
  ```

  **Console Output:**
  ```
  Global Middleware: POST false
  Route-Specific Middleware: POST method on /secure route
  ```

- **GET /profile/123/user/456**

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:4000/profile/123/user/456
  ```

  **Console Output:**
  ```
  Global Middleware: GET false
  Route-Specific Middleware: Any method on /profile route
  ```

**b. Testing HTTPS Requests**

- **GET /**

  ```bash
  curl -k https://localhost:4000/
  ```

  **Console Output:**
  ```
  Global Middleware: GET true
  Secure Middleware: GET, PATCH, POST methods over HTTPS
  ```

- **POST /secure**

  ```bash
  curl -k -X POST https://localhost:4000/secure
  ```

  **Console Output:**
  ```
  Global Middleware: POST true
  Secure Middleware: GET, PATCH, POST methods over HTTPS
  Route-Specific Middleware: POST method on /secure route
  ```

- **GET /profile/123/user/456**

  ```bash
  curl -k https://localhost:4000/profile/123/user/456
  ```

  **Console Output:**
  ```
  Global Middleware: GET true
  Secure Middleware: GET, PATCH, POST methods over HTTPS
  Route-Specific Middleware: Any method on /profile route
  ```

**Note:** The `-k` flag in `curl` is used to bypass SSL certificate verification for testing purposes. In a production environment, ensure that you have valid SSL certificates.

### **3. Observing Middleware Execution**

By examining the console outputs for each request, you can verify:

- **Global Middleware**: Always executes, logging the method and security status.
- **Secure Middleware**: Executes **only** for specified methods (`GET`, `PATCH`, `POST`) **and** when the request is over `HTTPS`.
- **Route-Specific Middlewares**: Execute based on the route and, if annotated, the HTTP method.

---

## **Conclusion**

In this lesson, you've learned how to control middleware execution in **Sapix** based on HTTP methods and the security protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS). By utilizing the `@method` and `@secure` annotations, you can finely tune which middlewares run under specific conditions, enhancing both the security and efficiency of your API.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Annotations Control Middleware Behavior**: Use `@method` to restrict middleware to specific HTTP methods and `@secure` to ensure middleware runs only over secure connections.
- **Protocol Awareness**: Middlewares can behave differently based on whether the request is made over HTTP or HTTPS, allowing for flexible and secure API design.
- **Testing is Crucial**: Always test your middleware configurations under both HTTP and HTTPS to ensure they behave as expected.

In the next lesson, you'll explore how to implement **query parameters** to further enhance the flexibility and functionality of your routes in **Sapix**.
