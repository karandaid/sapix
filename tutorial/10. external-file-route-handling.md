# **Sapix Tutorial - Lesson 10: Defining Route Handling in Separate External Files**

## **Overview**

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to define route handling logic in separate **external files** within **SapixRoutes**. This modular approach is particularly useful for keeping your route definitions clean and well-organized as your application grows. It allows you to place the route handlers in their respective files, which map directly to the URL structure of your routes.

## **What You Will Learn**

- How to set up **external files** for route handling in **SapixRoutes**.
- How the folder structure maps to the **API URL** and HTTP methods.
- How to handle requests by writing route handlers in external files for better organization and maintainability.

---

## **Step 1: Understanding the File Structure**

When using **external files** for route handling in **Sapix**, the file structure of your application maps directly to the **API URL** and **HTTP methods**. Each folder and file represent parts of the URL and the corresponding method (e.g., GET, POST, PATCH).

### **Folder Structure Example**

```
sapix_api/
├── api/
│   └── v1/
│       ├── product/
│       │   └── :id/
│       │       └── get.mjs
│       └── user/
│           └── :name/
│               └── get.mjs
```

### **Explanation**:
- **Folder Names**: Each folder corresponds to a segment in the URL. For example, `product/:id` represents `/product/[:id]` in the URL.
- **Method File Names**: Each file represents an HTTP method (e.g., `get.mjs` for GET requests, `post.mjs` for POST requests).

## **Step 2: Setting Up the Routes**

Here’s how to define the route without specifying the logic inline. The logic will be placed in external files.

### **Example: Defining the Route**

```javascript
import { SapixServer, SapixRoutes } from 'sapix';

// Create a new instance of SapixRoutes
const routes = new SapixRoutes();

// Define the routes without callback functions
routes.get('/product/[:id=number]');
routes.get('/user/[:name=string]');

// Initialize the server and attach the routes
const server = new SapixServer()
    .setPort(4000)
    .setRoute(routes)
    .start();

console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000');
```

### **Explanation**:
- **No Callback**: Notice that the `get` routes do not include a callback function. Instead, **Sapix** will look for the corresponding handler file in the file system that matches the URL structure and method.

---

## **Step 3: Creating the External Route Handlers**

Now, let’s create the route handling logic in separate files that map to the URL and method.

### **File Structure for External Handlers**

```
sapix_api/
├── api/
│   └── v1/
│       ├── product/
│       │   └── :id/
│       │       └── get.mjs
│       └── user/
│           └── :name/
│               └── get.mjs
```

### **File: `sapix_api/api/v1/product/:id/get.mjs`**

```javascript
export default function handleProductRequest(response, qrequest, uery, path_params, body) {
    const { id } = path_params;

    response.status(200).sendJSON({
        message: `Fetching product with ID ${id}`,
        id,
    });
}
```

### **File: `sapix_api/api/v1/user/:name/get.mjs`**

```javascript
export default function handleUserRequest(response, request, query, path_params, body) {
    const { name } = path_params;

    response.status(200).sendJSON({
        message: `Fetching user with name ${name}`,
        name,
    });
}
```

### **Explanation**:
- **Modular Handlers**: Each file defines a handler function that processes the request for a specific route. For example, the `get.mjs` under `product/:id/` handles GET requests for `/product/:id`.
- **Parameters**: The handler functions have access to the `response`, `query`, `path_params`, and `body` objects, allowing you to process requests and send appropriate responses.

## **Step 4: Testing the Routes with External Handlers**

Let’s test the routes by making GET requests that will trigger the corresponding handlers.

### **Testing the Product Route**

1. **GET** `/api/v1/product/123`
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Fetching product with ID 123",
       "id": "123"
     }
     ```

### **Testing the User Route**

2. **GET** `/api/v1/user/JohnDoe`
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Fetching user with name JohnDoe",
       "name": "JohnDoe"
     }
     ```

## **Step 5: Benefits of Using External Handlers**

Using external files for route handling provides several benefits:

1. **Better Organization**: Each route has its own dedicated file, making it easier to navigate and manage as your project grows.
2. **Scalability**: For larger projects with many routes, separating logic into files ensures that your route definitions remain clean and maintainable.
3. **Reusable Code**: You can create utility modules and share logic across multiple route handlers, improving reusability and reducing duplication.

## **Conclusion**

In this lesson, you learned how to define **route handling logic** in **external files** within **SapixRoutes**. This modular approach allows for better organization, scalability, and reusability of your code as your API grows. By using a folder structure that maps directly to your routes and methods, you can keep your routing logic clean and maintainable.

In the next lesson, we’ll cover **API grouping and versioning** using prefixes to structure your API efficiently.
